# UTF-8 Validation

> UTF-8 is a way to make computers understand different languages, like English, Chinese, and Arabic.

Computers use numbers to represent letters and symbols, and UTF-8 helps computers use these numbers to show words and sentences in different languages.

It's like a secret code that tells the computer which number corresponds to which letter or symbol, so it can show the right thing on the screen.

Without UTF-8, computers might get confused and show jumbled-up letters or weird symbols instead of the words you want to see!
